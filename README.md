Kala is a simplistic, modern, and performant job scheduler written in Go.  Features:

- Single binary
- No dependencies
- JSON over HTTP API
- Job Stats
- Configurable Retries
- Scheduling with ISO 8601 Date and Interval notation
- Dependent Jobs
- Persistent with several database drivers
- Web UI

**Note that it is not battle-tested. Use at your own risk.**

Kala was inspired by the desire for a simpler [Chronos](https://github.com/airbnb/chronos) (developed by Airbnb). Kala is Chronos for the rest of us.

If you need fault tolerance, distributed features, massive scale, then I recommend checking out [Chronos](https://github.com/airbnb/chronos). This is designed to be the Chronos for start-ups.

## Installing Kala

*Kala uses Go Modules*

1. Get Kala

	```
	go get github.com/ajvb/kala
	```

2. Run Kala

	```
	kala serve
	```

# Getting Started

Once you have installed Kala onto the machine you would like to use, you can follow the below steps to start using it.

To run Kala as a server:

```console
$ kala serve
INFO[0000] Preparing cache
INFO[0000] Starting server on port :8000

$ kala serve -p 2222
INFO[0000] Preparing cache
INFO[0000] Starting server on port :2222
```

Kala uses BoltDB by default for the job database by using `jobdb` and `boltpath` params:

```bash
kala serve --jobdb=boltdb --boltpath=/path/to/dir
```

use Redis by using the `jobdb`, `jobdb-address` and `jobdb-password` params:

```bash
kala serve --jobdb=redis --jobdb-address=127.0.0.1:6379 --jobdb-password=password
```

use Consul by using the `jobdb` and `jobdb-address` params:

```bash
kala serve --jobdb=consul --jobdb-address=127.0.0.1:8500
```

use Mongo by using the `jobdb`, `jobdb-address`, `jobdb-username`, and `jobdb-password` params:

```bash
kala serve --jobdb=mongo --jobdb-address=server1.example.com,server2.example.com --jobdb-username=admin --jobdb-password=password
```

use Postgres by using the `jobdb`, `jobdb-address` params:

```bash
kala serve --jobdb=postgres --jobdb-address=server1.example.com/kala --jobdb-username=admin --jobdb-password=password
```

use MariaDB, MySQL by using the `jobdb`, `jobdb-address`, `jobdb-tls-capath`, `jobdbTlsCertPath`, `jobdb-tls-keypath`, `jobdb-tls-servername` params:

```bash
kala serve --jobdb=mariadb --jobdb-address=(server1.example.com)/kala --jobdb-username=admin --jobdb-password=password

kala serve --jobdb=mysql --jobdb-address="tcp(server1.example.com:3306)/kala?tls=custom" --jobdb-username=admin --jobdb-password=password --jobdb-tls-capath=/path/to/server-ca.pem --jobdbTlsCertPath=/path/to/client-cert.pem --jobdb-tls-keypath=/path/to/client-key.pem --jobdb-tls-servername=server1.example.com
```

Kala runs on `127.0.0.1:8000` by default. You can easily test it out by curling the metrics path.

```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/stats/
{"Stats":{"ActiveJobs":2,"DisabledJobs":0,"Jobs":2,"ErrorCount":0,"SuccessCount":0,"NextRunAt":"2015-06-04T19:25:16.82873873-07:00","LastAttemptedRun":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","CreatedAt":"2015-06-03T19:58:21.433668791-07:00"}}
```

Once it's up in running, you can utilize curl or the official go client to interact with Kala. Also check out the examples directory.

### Examples of Usage

There are more examples in the [examples directory](https://github.com/ajvb/kala/tree/master/examples) within this repo. Currently its pretty messy. Feel free to submit a new example if you have one.

# Deployment

### Supervisord

After installing supervisord, open its config file (`/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf` is the default usually) and add something like:

```
[program:kala]
command=kala serve
autorestart=true
stdout_logfile=/var/log/kala.stdout.log
stderr_logfile=/var/log/kala.stderr.log
```

### Docker

If you have docker installed, you can build the dockerfile in this directory with
```docker build -t kala .```
and run it as a daemon with:
```docker run -it -d -p 8000:8000 kala```

## Job Data Struct

[Docs can be found here](http://godoc.org/github.com/ajvb/kala/job#Job)

## Things to Note

* If schedule is omitted, the job will run immediately.


## Job JSON Example

```
{
        "name":"test_job",
        "id":"93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd",
        "command":"bash /home/ajvb/gocode/src/github.com/ajvb/kala/examples/example-kala-commands/example-command.sh",
        "owner":"",
        "disabled":false,
        "dependent_jobs":null,
        "parent_jobs":null,
        "schedule":"R2/2015-06-04T19:25:16.828696-07:00/PT10S",
        "retries":0,
        "epsilon":"PT5S",
        "success_count":0,
        "last_success":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "error_count":0,
        "last_error":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "last_attempted_run":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "next_run_at":"2015-06-04T19:25:16.828794572-07:00"
}
```

## Breakdown of schedule string. (ISO 8601 Notation)

Example `schedule` string:

```
R2/2017-06-04T19:25:16.828696-07:00/PT10S
```

This string can be split into three parts:

```
Number of times to repeat/Start Datetime/Interval Between Runs
```

#### Number of times to repeat

This is designated with a number, prefixed with an `R`. Leave out the number if it should repeat forever.

Examples:

* `R` - Will repeat forever
* `R1` - Will repeat once
* `R231` - Will repeat 231 times.

#### Start Datetime

This is the datetime for the first time the job should run.

Kala will return an error if the start datetime has already passed.

Examples:

* `2017-06-04T19:25:16`
* `2017-06-04T19:25:16.828696`
* `2017-06-04T19:25:16.828696-07:00`
* `2017-06-04T19:25:16-07:00`

*To Note: It is recommended to include a timezone within your schedule parameter.*

#### Interval Between Runs

This is defined by the [ISO8601 Interval Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).

It starts with a `P`, then you can specify years, months, or days, then a `T`, preceded by hours, minutes, and seconds.

Lets break down a long interval: `P1Y2M10DT2H30M15S`

* `P` - Starts the notation
* `1Y` - One year
* `2M` - Two months
* `10D` - Ten days
* `T` - Starts the time second
* `2H` - Two hours
* `30M` - Thirty minutes
* `15S` - Fifteen seconds

Now, there is one alternative. You can optionally use just weeks. When you use the week operator, you only get that. An example of using the week operator for an interval of every two weeks is `P2W`.

Examples:

* `P1DT1M` - Interval of one day and one minute
* `P1W` - Interval of one week
* `PT1H` - Interval of one hour.

## Overview of routes

| Task | Method | Route |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Creating a Job | POST | /api/v1/job/ |
|Getting a list of all Jobs | GET | /api/v1/job/ |
|Getting a Job | GET | /api/v1/job/{id}/ |
|Deleting a Job | DELETE | /api/v1/job/{id}/ |
|Deleting all Jobs | DELETE | /api/v1/job/all/ |
|Getting metrics about a certain Job | GET | /api/v1/job/stats/{id}/ |
|Starting a Job manually | POST | /api/v1/job/start/{id}/ |
|Disabling a Job | POST | /api/v1/job/disable/{id}/ |
|Enabling a Job | POST | /api/v1/job/enable/{id}/ |
|Getting app-level metrics | GET | /api/v1/stats/ |


## /job

This route accepts both a GET and a POST. Performing a GET request will return a list of all currently running jobs.
Performing a POST (with the correct JSON) will create a new Job.

Note: When creating a Job, the only fields that are required are the `Name` and the `Command` field. But, if you omit the `Schedule` field, the job will be ran immediately.

Example:
```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/
{"jobs":{}}
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/ -d '{"epsilon": "PT5S", "command": "bash /home/ajvb/gocode/src/github.com/ajvb/kala/examples/example-kala-commands/example-command.sh", "name": "test_job", "schedule": "R2/2017-06-04T19:25:16.828696-07:00/PT10S"}'
{"id":"93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd"}
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/
{
    "jobs":{
        "93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd":{
            "name":"test_job",
            "id":"93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd",
            "command":"bash /home/ajvb/gocode/src/github.com/ajvb/kala/examples/example-kala-commands/example-command.sh",
            "owner":"",
            "disabled":false,
            "dependent_jobs":null,
            "parent_jobs":null,
            "schedule":"R2/2017-06-04T19:25:16.828696-07:00/PT10S",
            "retries":0,
            "epsilon":"PT5S",
            "success_count":0,
            "last_success":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "error_count":0,
            "last_error":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "last_attempted_run":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "next_run_at":"2017-06-04T19:25:16.828794572-07:00"
        }
    }
}
```

## /job/{id}

This route accepts both a GET and a DELETE, and is based off of the id of the Job. Performing a GET request will return a full JSON object describing the Job.
Performing a DELETE will delete the Job.

Example:
```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd/
{"job":{"name":"test_job","id":"93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd","command":"bash /home/ajvb/gocode/src/github.com/ajvb/kala/examples/example-kala-commands/example-command.sh","owner":"","disabled":false,"dependent_jobs":null,"parent_jobs":null,"schedule":"R2/2017-06-04T19:25:16.828696-07:00/PT10S","retries":0,"epsilon":"PT5S","success_count":0,"last_success":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","error_count":0,"last_error":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","last_attempted_run":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","next_run_at":"2017-06-04T19:25:16.828737931-07:00"}}
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd/ -X DELETE
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd/
```

## /job/stats/{id}

Example:
```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/stats/5d5be920-c716-4c99-60e1-055cad95b40f/
{"job_stats":[{"JobId":"5d5be920-c716-4c99-60e1-055cad95b40f","RanAt":"2017-06-03T20:01:53.232919459-07:00","NumberOfRetries":0,"Success":true,"ExecutionDuration":4529133}]}
```

```

## Debugging Jobs

There is a command within Kala called `run` which will immediately run a command as Kala would run it live, and then gives you a response on whether it was successful or not. Allows for easier and quicker debugging of commands.

```bash
$ kala run "ruby /home/user/ruby/my_ruby_script.rb"
Command Succeeded!
$ kala run "ruby /home/user/other_dir/broken_script.rb"
FATA[0000] Command Failed with err: exit status 1
```

## Dependent Jobs

### How to add a dependent job

Check out this [example for how to add dependent jobs](https://github.com/ajvb/kala/blob/master/examples/python/example_dependent_jobs.py) within a python script.

### Notes on Dependent Jobs

* Dependent jobs follow a rule of First In First Out
* A child will always have to wait until a parent job finishes before it runs
* A child will not run if its parent job does not.
* If a child job is disabled, it's parent job will still run, but it will not.
* If a child job is deleted, it's parent job will continue to stay around.
* If a parent job is deleted, unless its child jobs have another parent, they will be deleted as well.
