#### Currently in Alpha stage. Do not use in production environments.

Kala is a simplistic, modern, and performant job scheduler written in Go. It lives in a single binary and does not have any dependencies.

Kala was inspired by the desire for a simpler [Chronos](https://github.com/airbnb/chronos) (developed by Airbnb). Kala is Chronos for the rest of us.

It has a simple JSON over HTTP API, so it is language agnostic. It has Job Stats, Configurable Retries, uses ISO 8601 Date and Interval
notation, Dependant Jobs, and is Persistent (using BoltDB). Eventually it will have a Web UI.

#### Have any feedback or bugs to report?

Please create an issue within Github, or also feel free to email me at aj <at> ajvb.me

#### I need [fault tolerance, distributed-features, this to work at scale]

I recommend checking out [Chronos](https://github.com/airbnb/chronos). This is designed to be the Chronos for start-ups.

## Installing Kala

*Requires Go 1.0+ and git*

1. Get Kala

	```
	go get github.com/ajvb/kala
	```

2. Run Kala

	```
	kala run
	```

## Development

1. Change directory to Kala source

	```
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ajvb/kala
	```

2. Install godep

	```
	go get github.com/tools/godep
	```

3. Restore Godeps

	```
	godep restore
	```

4. Build the local Kala binary

	```
	go build
	```

5. Run local Kala

	```

# Getting Started

Once you have installed Kala onto the machine you would like to use, you can follow the below steps to start using it.

To Run Kala:
```bash
$ kala run
2015/06/10 18:31:31 main.go:59:func·001 :: INFO 002 Starting server on port :8000...

$ kala run -p 2222
2015/06/10 18:31:31 main.go:59:func·001 :: INFO 002 Starting server on port :2222...
```

Kala uses BoltDB by default for the job database, however you can also use Redis, Postgres or MySQL by using the jobDB and jobDBAddress params:

```bash
kala run --jobDB=redis --jobDBAddress=127.0.0.1:6379

kala run --jobDB=postgres --jobDBAddress=user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/dbname

kala run --jobDB=mysql --jobDBAddress=user:pass@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/dbname?parseTime=true
```

Kala runs on `127.0.0.1:8000` by default. You can easily test it out by curling the metrics path.

```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/stats/
{"Stats":{"ActiveJobs":2,"DisabledJobs":0,"Jobs":2,"ErrorCount":0,"SuccessCount":0,"NextRunAt":"2015-06-04T19:25:16.82873873-07:00","LastAttemptedRun":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","CreatedAt":"2015-06-03T19:58:21.433668791-07:00"}}
```

Once it's up in running, you can utilize curl or the official go client to interact with Kala. Also check out the examples directory.

### Examples of Usage

There are more examples in the [examples directory](https://github.com/ajvb/kala/tree/master/examples) within this repo. Currently its pretty messy. Feel free to submit a new example if you have one.

# Deployment

### Supervisord

After installing supervisord, open its config file (`/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf` is the default usually) and add something like:

```
[program:kala]
command=kala run
autorestart=true
stdout_logfile=/var/log/kala.stdout.log
stderr_logfile=/var/log/kala.stderr.log
```

### Docker

If you have docker installed, you can build the dockerfile in this directory with
```docker build -t kala .```
and run it as a daemon with:
```docker run -it -d -p 8000:8000 kala```

# API v1 Docs

All routes have a prefix of `/api/v1`

## Client Libraries

#### Official:
* Go - [client](https://github.com/ajvb/kala/tree/master/client) - Docs: http://godoc.org/github.com/ajvb/kala/client

Install using:
`go get github.com/ajvb/kala/client`

## Job Data Struct

[Docs can be found here](http://godoc.org/github.com/ajvb/kala/job#Job)

## Things to Note

* Currently, daylight savings time is not supported in the interval format.
* Currently, leap years are not supported in the interval format.
* If schedule is omitted, the job will run immediately.


## Job JSON Example

```
{
        "name":"test_job",
        "id":"93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd",
        "command":"bash /home/ajvb/gocode/src/github.com/ajvb/kala/examples/example-kala-commands/example-command.sh",
        "owner":"",
        "disabled":false,
        "dependent_jobs":null,
        "parent_jobs":null,
        "schedule":"R2/2015-06-04T19:25:16.828696-07:00/PT10S",
        "retries":0,
        "epsilon":"PT5S",
        "success_count":0,
        "last_success":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "error_count":0,
        "last_error":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "last_attempted_run":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "next_run_at":"2015-06-04T19:25:16.828794572-07:00"
}
```

## Breakdown of schedule string. (ISO 8601 Notation)

Example `schedule` string:

```
R2/2015-06-04T19:25:16.828696-07:00/PT10S
```

This string can be split into three parts:

```
Number of times to repeat/Start Datetime/Interval Between Runs
```

#### Number of times to repeat

This is designated with a number, prefixed with an `R`. Leave out the number if it should repeat forever.

Examples:

* `R` - Will repeat forever
* `R1` - Will repeat once
* `R231` - Will repeat 231 times.

#### Start Datetime

This is the datetime for the first time the job should run.

Kala will return an error if the start datetime has already passed.

Examples:

* `2015-06-04T19:25:16`
* `2015-06-04T19:25:16.828696`
* `2015-06-04T19:25:16.828696-07:00`
* `2015-06-04T19:25:16-07:00`

*To Note: It is recommended to include a timezone within your schedule parameter.*

#### Interval Between Runs

This is defined by the [ISO8601 Interval Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).

It starts with a `P`, then you can specify years, months, or days, then a `T`, preceded by hours, minutes, and seconds.

Lets break down a long interval: `P1Y2M10DT2H30M15S`

* `P` - Starts the notation
* `1Y` - One year
* `2M` - Two months
* `10D` - Ten days
* `T` - Starts the time second
* `2H` - Two hours
* `30M` - Thirty minutes
* `15S` - Fifteen seconds

Now, there is one alternative. You can optionally use just weeks. When you use the week operator, you only get that. An example of using the week operator for an interval of every two weeks is `P2W`.

Examples:

* `P1DT1M` - Interval of one day and one minute
* `P1W` - Interval of one week
* `PT1H` - Interval of one hour.

## Overview of routes

| Task | Method | Route |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Creating a Job | POST | /api/v1/job/ |
|Getting a list of all Jobs | GET | /api/v1/job/ |
|Getting a Job | GET | /api/v1/job/{id}/ |
|Deleting a Job | DELETE | /api/v1/job/{id}/ |
|Getting metrics about a certain Job | GET | /api/v1/job/stats/{id}/ |
|Starting a Job manually | POST | /api/v1/job/start/{id}/ |
|Getting app-level metrics | GET | /api/v1/stats/ |

## /job

This route accepts both a GET and a POST. Performing a GET request will return a list of all currently running jobs.
Performing a POST (with the correct JSON) will create a new Job.

Note: When creating a Job, the only fields that are required are the `Name` and the `Command` field. But, if you omit the `Schedule` field, the job will be ran immediately.

Example:
```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/
{"jobs":{}}
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/ -d '{"epsilon": "PT5S", "command": "bash /home/ajvb/gocode/src/github.com/ajvb/kala/examples/example-kala-commands/example-command.sh", "name": "test_job", "schedule": "R2/2015-06-04T19:25:16.828696-07:00/PT10S"}'
{"id":"93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd"}
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/
{
    "jobs":{
        "93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd":{
            "name":"test_job",
            "id":"93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd",
            "command":"bash /home/ajvb/gocode/src/github.com/ajvb/kala/examples/example-kala-commands/example-command.sh",
            "owner":"",
            "disabled":false,
            "dependent_jobs":null,
            "parent_jobs":null,
            "schedule":"R2/2015-06-04T19:25:16.828696-07:00/PT10S",
            "retries":0,
            "epsilon":"PT5S",
            "success_count":0,
            "last_success":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "error_count":0,
            "last_error":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "last_attempted_run":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "next_run_at":"2015-06-04T19:25:16.828794572-07:00"
        }
    }
}
```

## /job/{id}

This route accepts both a GET and a DELETE, and is based off of the id of the Job. Performing a GET request will return a full JSON object describing the Job.
Performing a DELETE will delete the Job.

Example:
```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd
{"job":{"name":"test_job","id":"93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd","command":"bash /home/ajvb/gocode/src/github.com/ajvb/kala/examples/example-kala-commands/example-command.sh","owner":"","disabled":false,"dependent_jobs":null,"parent_jobs":null,"schedule":"R2/2015-06-04T19:25:16.828696-07:00/PT10S","retries":0,"epsilon":"PT5S","success_count":0,"last_success":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","error_count":0,"last_error":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","last_attempted_run":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","next_run_at":"2015-06-04T19:25:16.828737931-07:00"}}
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd -X DELETE
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/93b65499-b211-49ce-57e0-19e735cc5abd
```

## /job/stats/{id}

Example:
```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/job/stats/5d5be920-c716-4c99-60e1-055cad95b40f/
{"job_stats":[{"JobId":"5d5be920-c716-4c99-60e1-055cad95b40f","RanAt":"2015-06-03T20:01:53.232919459-07:00","NumberOfRetries":0,"Success":true,"ExecutionDuration":4529133}]}
```

## /job/start/{id}

Example:
```bash

## Debugging Jobs

There is now a command within Kala called `run_command` which will immediately run a command as Kala would run it live, and then gives you a response on whether it was successful or not. Allows for easier and quicker debugging of commands.

```bash
$ kala run_command "ruby /home/user/ruby/my_ruby_script.rb"
Command Succeeded!
$ kala run_command "ruby /home/user/other_dir/broken_script.rb"
FATA[0000] Command Failed with err: exit status 1
```

## Dependent Jobs

### How to add a dependent job

Check out this [example for how to add dependent jobs](https://github.com/ajvb/kala/blob/master/examples/example_dependent_jobs.py) within a python script.

### Notes on Dependent Jobs

* Dependent jobs follow a rule of First In First Out
* A child will always have to wait until a parent job finishes before it runs
* A child will not run if its parent job does not.
* If a child job is disabled, it's parent job will still run, but it will not.
* If a child job is deleted, it's parent job will continue to stay around.
* If a parent job is deleted, unless its child jobs have another parent, they will be deleted as well.
